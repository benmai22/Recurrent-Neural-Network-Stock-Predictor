# Recurrent-Neural-Network-Stock-Predictor
Libraries Used: Numpy, Pandas, Sklearn, Matplotlib, TensorFlow

In this project, I used a CSV file containing the Google stock price history to train a model that can be used to help predict the prices. At the end of this file, I was able to get to a point where an individual can compare the "Actual vs Predicted Price" on a chart so that they can see if their model needs any improvements.
